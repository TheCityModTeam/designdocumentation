##Someone posted about a single city mod idea recently on this sub. I want to work on over the summer and I already have a bunch of ideas to proceed.

So, there are basically two directions this mod could go. The first one is a full scale total conversion and set in a more modern era. The second is a smaller scale total conversion, setting it in the CK2 era. In terms of gameplay the specifics would probably be different but the general ideas remain the same regardless of time setting. Note - most of the ideas are shaped around modern crime but adjusting them to the medieval standard shouldn't be difficult at all - I do have some info on what happened in cities during the medieval era.

###Factions (governments):
So the game would need a bunch of different playable and non-playable factions.

Generally, we can classify them in three groups:

1. Criminal (playable)
2. Business (playable)
3. Law and order (not playable)

**Criminal:** There would be two kinds - unorganized and organized crime. This would be similar to tribals upgrading to feudal. They would have a bunch of different kinds of levies, and 0 retinues. I haven't figured out the specifics but unorganized crime would generally have light troops (thugs) who are weak but easy to replenish and very cheap to maintain. Organized crime would have a better kind of light troops and a higher number of heavy troops. In general, you do not want to remain in unorganized crime for very long. There would be some perks to balance unorganized crime in the early game but mid game it would just be inferior. They would also be able to hold fewer holdings personally but suffer no penalties for vassal levies. Organized crime would reduce vassal levies but still suffer no penalty. Being criminal, they would not get any protection from the law and wars would make the police forces hostile towards them. If they do too much damage the police may also declare war on them as punishment.

**Business:** Many different kinds of organization - entrepreneurs (like tribals). Family business (like feudal). Public companies and private companies (like elective/merchant republic). Generally they would make a lot of money, pay taxes to the mayor and enjoy the protection of the law. Other than some security troops, they would not have many forces. They could however hire extra police protection and private security to defend themselves. They would expand via mergers and acquisitions, something I'm still trying to figure out the exact mechanics of. Most likely it would be a vassalize option, by paying some cash. Vassals of the law and order faction would be an unplayable government-owned business type.

**Law and order:** This is not playable as a design decision and it acts as a sort of insurance policy. While I don't intend to make them OP like EVE online police, they would generally have some retinues in the form of beat cops, and quality levies like SWAT. If they start losing they could also request assistance from higher level governments (not represented in-game) in the form of special event troops. They would be led by the mayor who would be an emperor-level title. Players at most could reach king-level (or lower, haven't decided). The chief of police would be a king-level vassal of the mayor. The succession of the police would be seniority, and the succession of the mayor would be with the same mechanism used to elect the pope.

###City organization

The city would be organized various parts. Downtown would be the rich duchy-like (zone) entity (silk road mechanics). Another part could be the government plaza. It would house the government buildings such as the mayor's and his councillors' offices. There would also be special provinces called city entrances at a few different parts of the map. The riverine provinces would have the docks (another rich duchy). Other areas include suburbs, industrial zone. I'm pretty certain that the map shouldn't be as big as our current game map, but a size that is similar to most of Western and Northern Europe seems like a fun game. The number of holdings in a province would depend on the zone it is in.

###Other thoughts

While the government mechanics are sort of fixed, everything is not set in stone - you could have characters in the different types colluding. For instance corrupt cops could provide equipment (tech boost, troop damage increase) to gangsters in exchange for bribes. Businessmen could hire gangsters to take out rival businesses in order to acquire them cheaply. Or they could hire assassins, wherein if they're caught law and order could crack down on them. The criminals could try to oust the mayor through war. The police chief could try to become mayor, thus turning the city into a police state.
